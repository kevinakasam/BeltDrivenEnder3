### ‚ù§Ô∏è Support my work

All my work is 100% Open-Source and free for everyone to use. But designing and developing all these mods takes a lot of time and effort, so if you appreciate my work and would like to support it and also help cover the costs of gettings the mods perfect, you can use one of the following links. Thanks a lot ü§ç

### Further notes
#### Versions vs. Variants
This mod now exists in the 3rd version (V3). The _ignore folder contains all the files for the old versions (V1 and V2). The current version (V3) exists in 3 variations:V-Wheels, MGN-12h and Dual Z (Dual Z works with both variants V-Wheels and MGN-12h). In addition, you can choose between the normal and ultralow version. I hope this clarifies the confusion between the versions and variants. Again please use the config finder on my [website](https://www.kevinakasam.com/belt-driven-ender-3/) to configure your individual setup.

#### Attention!
I'm not an expert and 3D printing is my hobby. So please be careful when you rebuild this mod and don't just go ahead. For my printer the parts fit perfectly.
Everybody bears the risks of a modification himself.
All parts can be modified as you like. :D

#### Print settings
All Parts can be printed without support. Keep the orientation for best results. Yes, you can use PLA but no, you shouldn‚Äôt use PLA. I used PETG for the unenclosured, ABS for the enclosured printer. Suggested print settings: 50% Infill, 5 Walls/Top-Bottom layer.
Good luck and happy printing!

#### Why I made the Mod:
My Ender 3 always had problems with the Z-axis, which were caused by a bent and misaligned leadscrew. Therefore I decided to convert the Ender to belts in Z as well.
This mod also solves the problem of a hanging x-axis on the right side. Because of the two belts, both sides run synchronously and can also be adjusted very precisely.

#### What this Mod can't do:
This mod can't solve problems that are caused by an inconsitent extrusion. Inconsitent extrusion means an untuned Flowrate/Extrusion multiplier and causes very inconsitent layers --> this looks like the picture below. To get rid of that you should tune all extrusion related values, like Flowrate an Linear Advance (Marlin) / Pressure Advance (Klipper). Take a look at this [tuning guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/), its very well made (Works also for non Voron Printers and Marlin machines).

#### <img src="_ignore/Pictures/powge.jpg" width="75"/> Powered by Powge! 
I am very very proud to announce that there is now a Motion Kit for this mod available for purchase! The Motion Kit from Powge provides all parts for Single Z or Dual Z, with F623 or 20T Idlers and in black or silver. This allows us to use high quality parts at a low price! Belts and pulleys match up perfectly and make the mod a little better. Thanks to Powge for this opportunity! (btw Aliexpress shows delivery times of several months, but shipping is significantly faster (to Germany it takes about 10 days)).

#### A word about *linear rails*.
There's a reason I haven't made a rail version in a very long time: Rails are not better than rollers in ***terms of quality***. At least the cheap rails you can buy on AliExpress. The tolerances are not good, they don't last long and can give z artifacts that you don't have with rollers. From time to time I get messages that the x axis drops as soon as the power is turned off. Every time that happens the mod uses rails. And like almost of those has cheap china rails. The problem with these cheap rails is that there is no friction at all, no tension and the Z axis is very poorly guided. The little Z motor has to carry all the weight because the rails are so loose they can't take any load. 
You also have to take care of the rails, lubricate and clean them from time to time, and make sure they don't leak. So you will spend a lot of money on a set of rails if you want good rails. Plus lubricants, cleaners, etc. Also, mounting the rails is more complicated. With wheels, you spent almost nothing on a new wheel, put it on, and you are good to go.
So I recommend trying wheels first and if you still want rails, you just need to print two small adapters to install the rails. Keep things simple ;)
  
#### How to use the toothed idlers
You have to remove the flage of the toothed idlers, otherwise they would get in contact with the profile.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank everyone who supported this project, especially *Guffy* and the *Awesome Helpers* from my Discord! 
Also a big thank you to my mate Deutherius who helped me with the initial setup of this mod!

#### Thank you Voron
This mod uses a modified transmission from the Voron 2.2. I made a different frame to mount it on the Ender 3. The tensionerarm and the tensionerring are from the Voron guys. These aren‚Äôt my work!!! The mount and the 80T gear are made by myself. Because the parts will be updated regularly, you can find the STLs I used on GitHub 

#### THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
I want to thank everyone who has helped me over the last months with feedback, support and confidence. Without you this mod would not have become sich a thing! Thanks also to Creality for the Golbal DIY Contest. I am very proud to announce that I could reach the 3rd place with his mod.

## Keybak
<img src="_ignore/Pictures/KeyBack_1.png" width="300"/> <img src="_ignore/Pictures/KeyBack_2.png" width="300"/>

Keybak system similar to the Switchwire design.
The files were remixed from the Switchwire CAD file.
For licensing reasons, all Keybak files are uploaded to GitHub only!
Idea from Voron team, thanks!

**Info: Because of the transmission it is not necessary to install a Keybak system.**
The 1:5 ratio increases the holding force of the motor so that it can hold the X axis up even when it is powered off.
A correctly adjusted belt tension is important for this.
If you are using the V-Wheels it is also important that they are installed correctly (See Troubleshooting).
From time to time I hear that users struggle to keep the axis up by using the belt tension only.
Therefore, I have designed the Keybak system. See BOM for all the parts you need.

What is a Keybak system and what is it for?
A Keybak is actually used to secure keys to a wire rope.
Depending on the Keybak, they can support a lot of weight without the cord extending on its own.
The Keybak used here is strong enough to support the x axis. It takes the load off the motor and shares the weight of the axis with it.
__It is still important to tension the belts properly!
If the belts are not tightened enough, there will be unclean prints later!__
So make sure that the Keybak doesn't mislead you into not tightening the belts enough.
See my FAQ video on how to properly tension the belts (video coming soon).

You will have to print a new 1_LeftTop_A and a 3_spacer to use the Keybak.

## FAQ 
### Do I need to change the firmware?
NO! You do not have to change anything in the firmware. This modification works with the stock board and stock firmware.

### Can I use PLA to print the parts?
Yes and no. All parts should work with PLA, except the motor tensioner arm. The motor has to hold more weight now, so the motor could get warm. Since PLA deforms at ~40¬∞C you should keep an eye on your motor (see troubleshooting). Because of that I would recommend PETG. When you're printing inside an enclosure you should use ABS. Try Esun ABS+, super easy to print, and much stronger than PETG.

### Is this mod also compatible with the Ender 3 V2/Pro etc?
YES! You can use this mod with all Ender 3 versions.

### Can use this for my Creality CR printer?
View the makes on Thingiverse. Some of you made a CR build so I thing it should fit. Feel free to give some feedback about that.

### Do I need a hardened steelrod?
NO! A cheap aluminium or "normal" steelrod is just fine. There's also a transmission (rotated and unrotated) that hold a bearing inside, so you have some extra support in the middle of your rod. You also could use your leadscrew to minimize the costs.

### Dual Z? G34?
So you want to use two stepper motors to have an indipendent z axis? Thats possible of course! Just use the files from the Dual Z folder! See BOM for detailed parts list.

### I have a special question/ I need a custom version but I'm new to CAD. Can you help me?
Yes of course! I'm happy to help, so please contact me via Discord (kevinakasam#2097). I'm sure we will find a solution for your problem :)

### Can I support your work?
Thank you very much if you want to support my work! But please dont feel obligated to do so. All parts are free and open source and will stay that way! If you still want to support me, you can find a donation link at the bottom of this page. Really many many thanks! :)

## Troubleshooting
### My Z motor moves in the wrong direction!
Thats a quick fix. Just remove all the pins in you motor connector that goes into the mainboard (like I showed you in my video) and insert them in the opposite order (4321 instead of 1234).

### My Z motor gets super hot!
First of all: A warm or slighty hot motor isn't a super bad thing. But you should change that. Try to lower your V-ref/Amps till the motor stays hand warm. But be careful to not reduce the current too much, or your motor will lose steps. The stock Z motor is very small so it's a big job for the tiny motor. Don't worry if your motor gets warm.

### My z axis drops as soon as power off my printer!
Probably the most asked question, but I can promise that your axis does not have to drop! As already mentioned, the z motor is very small. Therefore the magnetic field that exists in the motor even without power isn't very strong. But it's strong enough to keep the axis up.
#### I don't care, my axis is dropping, what can I do?
1. You are using the original V-Rollers? Be sure they are properly set up. Turn the eccentric nut until the rollers are in contact with the profile. Put a little tension on the rollers, but not too much! Do not risk a flat spot of your rollers. The tension is correct when they are tight, and you can't turn them with your finger in the same place, but the axis moves when you turn the rollers.
2. You have no rollers or your axis is still dropping? Tension your long belts a little more. Increase the tension until your axis stops dropping. Be careful not to break something. But the parts can take a lot of tension. Otherwise, check out my FAQ video about how to tension the belts (THE VIDEO HAS STILL TO BE CREATED).
3. Tension the small looped belt a bit more as well. But very carefully! Usually the tension only needs to be high enough to keep the belt from slipping over the printed wheel. But you can increase the tension a little bit. But not too much, otherwise the motor can't turn anymore.
4. That sounds too complicated? Your motor is also too hot? A solution would be a bigger motor, like the one on the X and Y axis. A bigger motor is able to hold the axis up very easily, with less tension and less heat. But as I said, this is not necessary, it also works with the original motor.
5. New solution: Install the Keybak System (added 31.10.2021).
