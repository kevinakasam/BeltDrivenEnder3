# This is a 2 part mod to the mod
1. This uses a GT2 20t and 60t kit that is easily purchased from amazon/aliexpress. [The kit I used](https://www.amazon.com/Pulley-Aluminum-Timing-Synchronous-Printer/dp/B0C5J9BM45/ref=sr_1_21?crid=Z7KVO3Y9T3IG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YvnJuRsQZk7EHyMqDNTZpcxtA0aGETf3GDBYU92K3B5-8kDsOU034Bu0j0Dg6GBt0PA_PuQiWs2fb0koJLlyBW2F-KQkyrpBjM6OXtLGffliSeiRML1S-XxxKpTymB-GWvI3aUUhEMuGJm1y2Z3Ghc0SPAMzeV7J2-A48Vmi1zgNAAJw7bDUL-uUt8Jhpp7k_BIABDWbAuoRmzgbB99a4fSGmyaprPlyvlCdQHCls3K4pDvVCJPrLYpHcSpk-9uLRTcvZskOwjdOlbNnaJ4ctzX4jAfCzOsjeXWkwYfMrr4.xBKHfXnlxUc4uiSpdHrHSk4tK6vfqo0sx9u7m5cPVFQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=gt2%2Btiming%2Bbelt%2Band%2Bpulley%2B8mm%2Bbore&qid=1714838890&s=industrial&sprefix=gt2%2Btiming%2Bbelt%2Band%2Bpulley%2B8mm%2Bbor%2Cindustrial%2C110&sr=1-21&th=1)
2. It bumps the distance of the top pieces 1.5mm diagonally away from the frame at the top.

The main advantages 
- You don't have to disassemble a pulley to insert it into a 3d printed pulley.
- The kit will come with the belt of appropriate length, 2x 8mm 20T to run the z up and down and 2x 80t pulleys of which you need 1, so you get an extra 80t pulley and belt. 
- Reuse the leadscrew from the z-axis

The 60t alluminum pulley will be too close to the frame without the modded ultra long transmission. 
However I think this changes the distance on steps/mm for your z-axis, so make sure you recalibrate it.
